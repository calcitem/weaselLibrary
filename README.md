# Introduction
This C++ library are used by the applications in other repositories (Traga 2, Muehle). 

## compressor
This is a generic wrapper for external compression algorithms.

## DirectXTK11
Modified header files from the [DirectX Tool Kit Samples](https://github.com/walbourn/directxtk-samples) adapted for the wildWeasel library.

## minimax
Implementation of the minimax, alpha-beta and retro analysis algorithmn used by 'Muehle'. It also contains GUI functions for the creation and inspection of the database.

## permutationGameSolver
Own algorithmn to solve a permutation games. It also contains GUI functions for the creation and inspection of the database.

## wildWeasel
Library providing simple GUI elements and standard system functionality (mouse and keybord input, sounds, message box, etc.). 
It's main purpose is to have a common interface for all applications of this repository without using a specific API.
